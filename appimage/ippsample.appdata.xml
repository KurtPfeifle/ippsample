	<summary>Sample implementations for IPP Server, IPP Clients, IPP Printers, IPP Find tool and IPP Proxies</summary>
	<description>
		<p>"ippfind": The ippfind program implements Bonjour/DNS-SD discovery of IPP printers and can be used to find and test specific printers. Among other things, it is used as part of the IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification test tools.
"ipptool": The ipptool program implements a generic IPP Client interface that allows a user to send different IPP requests and act based on the response from the Printer. Among other things, it is used as part of the IPP Everywhere Printer Self-Certification test tools.
"ippproxy": The ippproxy program implements a generic IPP Proxy interface that allows you to connect a local IPP or PCL printer to an IPP Infrastructure Printer such as the ippserver program.
"ippserver": The ippserver program implements a generic IPP Printer interface that allows you to host shared printers using the IPP Shared Infrastructure Extensions as well as support local printing or document processing.

"ipptransform": The ipptransform program is a generic file conversion utility that is used primarily with ippserver to support rasterization of JPEG and PDF documents for IPP Everywhere and HP PCL printers.</p>
